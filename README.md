# Billing-system-using-C
This project is a comprehensive billing system implemented in C, designed for retail environments where groceries, beverages, and cosmetics are sold. It features a command-line interface that allows users to input quantities for various products, calculate the total cost in both Indian Rupees (INR) and US Dollars (USD), and apply discounts based on the total amount spent.
